NLTK-Viz
========

Combination of Python/NLTK code and D3.js for visually summarizing the output of customer comments.  Counts keywords across URLs, and lets the user browse the original text interactively.  Both KW counts and the sentences from which they're generated are read from the same json.  This approach attempts to  solve for the endless variation in text processing program requirements that arise from both changing consumer base and agile product offerings by partially unloading the interpretive work to the graph user.
